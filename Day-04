# ðŸ“… Day-04: JavaScript Fundamentals - Scope & Shadowing

## âœ… Topics Studied Today

Todayâ€™s focus was on core JavaScript concepts:

- `let` and `const` declarations
- Block Scope
- Shadowing in JavaScript

Although I couldnâ€™t study too much today, I made sure to keep the momentum going with at least some key concepts.

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- **`let` and `const`** are block-scoped and do not get hoisted like `var`.
- **Block Scope** ensures that variables declared inside `{}` are not accessible outside.
- **Shadowing** occurs when a variable in an inner scope has the same name as one in an outer scope, temporarily overriding it within the inner scope.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

> Even on light days, consistent effort adds up.  
> Revisiting these concepts will help solidify the foundation for async JS and closures later.
